## What is CympleTech
we focus on build modern data security for everyone. Everyone should have the ownership of their data, your place, your rules.

## What is ESSE
ESSE (Encrypted Symmetrical Session Engine) An open source encrypted peer-to-peer system for data security, and allow data to be sent securely from one terminal to another without going through third-party services.

ESSE, positioned as an engine. The engine is coded in Rust language based on TDN framework, and the cross-platform user interface is built using Flutter.

**Features**

- Data Security Fortress
- Encryption Everywhere
- Distributed Identity
- Distributed Devices
- Distributed Notes & Files
- Distributed Storage & Synchronization
- Built-in IM Application
- Built-in Group Chat Application
- Built-in Domain Application
- Built-in Wallet Application (Support ETH/ERC20/ERC721)
- Built-in Robot assistant Application
- Multi-identity System
- Multi-platform Support: Android, iOS, iPadOS, MacOS, Windows, Linux, etc.

## What is TDN
Trusted Distributed Network. (Also a micro-framework for building blockchain-like applications).

TDN: Let data transfer safely, make the network stable, secure, and highly available.

As the network interconnection, TDN includes peer-to-peer, centralized gateway, proxy & relay service, LAN, RPC, Near, etc.

As the framework of decentralized applications, TDN uses the Layer and Group models. We built this framework because we feel that the blockchain is very limited. If you want a more open and free distributed application development technology, and Pluggable, lightweight application framework, TDN can satisfy you.
